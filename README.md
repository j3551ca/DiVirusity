# DiVirusity
Quantify viral genetic diversity within hosts from NGS data (paired-end raw reads) without needing to reconstruct full-length haplotypes.

3 diversity metrics are used (Shannon Diversity, Nucleotide (pi) Diversity, and Alternate Allele Frequency) to quanitfy the amount of genetic variation ocurring at each locus in the minority of a viral population infecting a host. 

This requires 2 other programs LoFreq (https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq) and SNPGenie (
